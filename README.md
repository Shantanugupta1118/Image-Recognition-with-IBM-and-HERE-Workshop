# Image Recognition with IBM and HERE Workshop

Ever wondered on how we can add AI when it comes to location based services? In this code we upload pass an image to a Python Flask Application and get recommendation based on the food picture you have passed.

## Architecture

1. User passes an image in the python code
1. As we are using the visual recognition service there is a out of the box food model which we are going to use and it detects the name of the food which we have passed
1. The name of the food is then passed to the Here Maps Discover API which then suggests places around a particular location which we have configured within the python application.
